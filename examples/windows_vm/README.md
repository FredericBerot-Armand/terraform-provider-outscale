This example shows how to create a VM with a Windows OMI with:
- client-side generated keypair
- security group and rules
- public IP
- resized bootdisk volume

Once created, you should be able to connect to VM using [RDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol). The VM ip is written to `ip.txt`, the user is by default `Administrator` and its password is decrypted in `password.txt`.
